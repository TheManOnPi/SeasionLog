# SessionLog

SessionLog is a productivity tool that logs when you start working.

# How it works

- Start a session by typing what you’re working on, and add a reason or intention if you want.
- When you’re done, finish the session. If something interrupts you can say what happened, e.g. you were distracted, avoiding, busy with something important, or something else?
- The app records how long you worked, what happened, and when.
- Every session is saved to a local JSON file—no internet required.
- You can scroll back through your daily sessions to see what happened.

# Technical details

- Everything’s in one file: app.py.
- Only uses Python’s standard library and Tkinter for the interface.
- Runs anywhere with Python 3 and Tk installed.
- Your data stays on your computer in sessions.json.
